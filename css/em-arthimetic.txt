Abstract: A simple explanation of em-value arithmetic to encourage its
  use in place of absolute measurements like `px`.
Subject: CSS em values

(Note that ex is CSS3, so unfortunately we can't use it yet on public
pages.)

`em` should always be used in measurements instead of `px` unless
pixel-specific measurements are required (e.g. when using images);
this allows styles to scale cleanly. We know this already.

What I see often is confusion on how to apply it cleanly relative to
other elements (e.g. for padding, relative positioning, etc); there's
often guess work involved, or people revert to `px'. Here's an example
of how it works for those interested.

Say we have:

  .foo { margin-left: 5em; }

5em is relative to the font size of the parent of the element matching
`.foo'.  Now say we have:

  .foo > h1 { font-size: 2em; }

And we want the h1 to be a hanging indent (ignore the left margin). We
cannot simply do this:

  .foo > h1 { font-size: 2em; margin-left: -5em; }

as that would hang too far too the left: h1's font size is doubled and
so its the effect on its margin. The solution is:

  .foo > h1 { font-size: 2em; margin-left -2.5em; }

This will be pixel-perfect flush with the left margin.

If we have:

  .foo2 { margin-left: 7em; }
  .foo2 > h1 { font-size: 3em; }

then the same logic applies, which is why you will sometimes see very
specific em-values:

  .foo2 > h1 { font-size: 3em; margin-left: 2.333em; }


So, as a final example:

  .foo { font-size: 2em; }
  .foo > .bar { font-size: 1.25em; }
  .foo > .bar > .baz { font-size: 0.5em; }

The font sizes are:

  .foo = 2em
  .bar = 2.5em
  .baz = 1.25em

Hope that helps. Developer tools will show you the calculated values
if you inspect the elements and choose the "computed" tab on the right
(in either FF or Chrom(ium)). It is simple arithmetic, but I think web
developers tend to get confused by all the cascading that goes on
(they are cascading stylesheets, after all).

Now there's no excuse to not use em-values. ;)
