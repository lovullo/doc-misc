Abstract: AutoHotkey can be used to manage Windows' hotkeys and bind
  arbitrary scripts. Here, I use it to try to pretend that Windows
  does not exist on my work PC.
Subject: Windows hotkey stuffs

This may or may not be useful to Jim/Jeff, but I'm including them
anyway in case they want to do crazy scripting stuffs.

Since I have my GNU/Linux VM that I work primarily out of, I found the
default Windows hotkeys to be far too intrusive. In particular, I use
the Windows key with my window manager (e.g. Win+L is supposed to
resize a window in the tiling window manager, not lock my screen).

Windows' window manager is odd in that it's inconceivably
uncustomizable through conventional means. So I found this:

== Disabling Windows HotKeys ==
I'd rather handle my own mappings using AutHotkey. You can disable
Win+X hotkeys using gpedit.msc:

  User Configuration
  -> Administrative Templates
  -> All Settings
  -> Turn off Windows+X Hotkeys

But this does not disable Win+L. And for those who care (probably
not), here's how to disable it (by default, AutoHotkey will run the
script for #l, but Windows will still lock the screen).

The problem is, that disables locking the workstation entirely! :O As
in, there's no possible way to lock it, even with DllCall. So here's
my solution (AutoHokey script) to use Win+PrintScreen (which I used to
use on my GNU/Linux system):

#PrintScreen::
  RegWrite, REG_DWORD, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System, DisableLockWorkstation, 0
  Sleep 100
  DllCall("LockWorkStation")
  Sleep 100
  RegWrite, REG_DWORD, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System, DisableLockWorkstation, 1
  Run "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\ssh.exe" gerwitm-ubuntu2 afd
return
